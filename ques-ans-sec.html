  <h2> Question / Answer : </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>What is the source of virus?</h3><b>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
      emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of
      coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.</b></li>
    <li><h3>How does virus spreads?</h3><b>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
      person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.</b></li>
    <li><h3>Can someone who has been quarantine for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?</h3><b>Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from
      others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed
      illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19
      quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.</b></li>
    <li><h3>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread though food, including refrigerated or frozen food?</h3><b>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to
      support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing
      your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

      It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

      In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen
      temperatures.</b></li>
    <li><h3>Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?</h3><b>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that
      does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the
      transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</b></li>
    <li><h3>What is community spread?</h3><b>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</b></li>
    <li><h3>What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?</h3><b>Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data
      for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.</b></li>
    <li><h3>Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?</h3><b>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is
      from person to person.</b></li>
    <li><h3>Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?</h3><b>Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people who may be at
      higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes:<ul>
        <li>Older adults</li>
        <li>People who have serious underlying medical conditions like:<ul>
            <li>Heart disease</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Lung disease</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul></b>
    </li>
    <li><h3>What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?</h3><b>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and
      others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as
      possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.</b></li>
    <li><h3>How do I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?</h3><b>You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.<ul>
        <li>Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
        <li>Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing).</li>
        <li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)</li>
        <li>Launder items including washable plush toys as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty
          laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.</li>
      </ul></b>
    </li>
    <li><h3>What should I do if there is an outbreak in my community?</h3><b>During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:<ul>
        <li>Protect yourself and others<ul>
            <li>Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Put your household plan into action.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation.</b> Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.</li>
          <li><b>Continue practicing everyday preventive actions.</b>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that
            contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.</li>
          <li><b>Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.</b>Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed
            temporarily.</li>
          <li><b>Stay in touch with others by phone or email.</b> If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends,
            especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.</li>

        </ul>
      </ul></b>
    </li>
    <li><h3>What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?</h3><b>This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including
      serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local
      media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

      If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

      Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
      </b>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?</h3><b>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older
        adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
        <br />
        Based upon available information to date, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include:
      <ul>
        <li>People aged 65 years and older</li>
        <li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>
        <li>Other high-risk conditions could include:<ul>
            <li>People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
            <li>People who have heart disease with complications</li>
            <li>People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment</li>
            <li>People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk</li>
      </ul></b>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?</h3><b>Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
      seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</b></li>
