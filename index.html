      <p class="intro-virus"><b>Virus, an infectious agent of small size and simple composition that can multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. The name is from a Latin word meaning ‚Äúslimy liquid‚Äù or ‚Äúpoison‚Äù.The primary role of
        the virus or virion
        is to ‚Äúdeliver its DNA or RNA genome into the host cell so that the genome can be expressed (transcribed and translated) by the host cell,‚Äù according to "Medical Microbiology."


        First, viruses need to access the inside of a host‚Äôs body. Respiratory passages and open wounds can act as gateways for viruses. Sometimes insects provide the mode of entry. Certain viruses will hitch a ride in an insect‚Äôs saliva and enter
        the host‚Äôs body after the insect bites. According to the authors of ‚ÄúMolecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Ed‚Äù (Garland Science, 2002) such viruses can replicate inside both insect and host cells, ensuring a smooth transition from one to the
        other. Examples include the viruses that cause yellow fever and dengue fever.

        Viruses will then attach themselves to host cell surfaces. They do so by recognizing and binding to cell surface receptors, like two interlocking puzzle pieces. Many different viruses can bind to the same receptor and a single virus can bind
        different cell surface receptors. While viruses use them to their advantage, cell surface receptors are actually designed to serve the cell.

        After a virus binds to the surface of the host cell, it can start to move across the outer covering or membrane of the host cell. There are many different modes of entry. HIV, a virus with an envelope, fuses with the membrane and is pushed
        through. Another enveloped virus, the influenza virus, is engulfed by the cell. Some non-enveloped viruses, such as the polio virus, create a porous channel of entry and burrow through the membrane.

        Once inside, viruses release their genomes and also disrupt or hijack various parts of the cellular machinery. Viral genomes direct host cells to ultimately produce viral proteins (many a time halting the synthesis of any RNA and proteins
        that the host cell can use). Ultimately, viruses stack the deck in their favor, both inside the host cell and within the host itself by creating conditions that allow for them to spread. For example, when suffering from the common cold, one
        sneeze emits 20,000 droplets containing rhinovirus or coronavirus particles, according to "Molecular Biology of the Cell." Touching or breathing those droplets in, is all it takes for a cold to spread.</b></p>

        <p class="corona-virus"><b>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause illness in people, and others that circulate among mammals and birds. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can spread to humans, and then spread between people.
          Zoonotic coronaviruses
          have emerged in recent years to cause human outbreaks such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

          Illness in humans mainly manifests as a respiratory infection, or sometimes gastrointestinal infection. The clinical spectrum of illness varies from no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms to severe, rapidly progressive pneumonia, acute
          respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, or multiorgan failure resulting in death.</b></p>

      <h2>Symptoms of Coronavirus:</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="symptoms-and-precautions">


        <p><b>The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment. People who have underlying
          medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.

          <br>Common symptoms include:
          <ol>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Tiredness</li>
            <li>Dry cough</li>
          </ol>



          Other symptoms include:
          <ol>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Aches and pains</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose</li>
          </ol>




          People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.

          People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.</b></p>

      <h2>Precautions of Coronavirus:</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="symptoms-and-precautions">


        <b>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
          <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
          <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
          <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
          <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
          <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>
          <li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</li>
